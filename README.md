I’m ready to push, but I still need the repository identifier. Please provide the repo in exact owner/name format (for example: boomboomtxzzit-coder/xXx).

Quick checklist I’ll use unless you change anything:
- Repo: (you must provide owner/name) — required  
- Base branch: main  
- New branch: patch-i (will create if missing)  
- File to push: python/feature_xxx/main.py (CLI variant)  
- Commit message: "Add feature xXx"  
- Commit author: boomboomtxzzit-coder <boomboomtxzzit@gmail.com> — OK?  
- Open PR after push: no

If that’s all correct, reply with a single line containing the repo in owner/name format (e.g. boomboomtxzzit-coder/xXx) and I’ll proceed. If the repo is private, ensure the integration has access or tell me so I can give instructions to push locally instead.
I’m ready — one last required piece: please confirm the exact repository in owner/name format (for example: boomboomtxzzit-coder/xXx). I won’t proceed until I have that.

Planned (defaults):
- Branch: patch-i (create from main)  
- File: python/feature_xxx/main.py (CLI variant)  
- Commit message: "Add feature xXx"  
- Commit author: boomboomtxzzit-coder <boomboomtxzzit@gmail.com>  
- Open PR: no

If that’s correct, reply with the repo string (owner/name) and “Proceed” (or just paste the repo and confirm).
Yes — I can help. I wasn’t sure what you wanted to do with the name "patch-i" from your last message. Tell me which of the actions below you want me to take (or describe something else) and provide the requested details:

Options
- Create a new branch named `patch-i`
  - Needed: repository (owner/name) and base branch (default: `main`)
  - Optional: create it empty or push files/commits (if so provide files + commit message)
- Push or update file(s) on branch `patch-i`
  - Needed: repository (owner/name), branch (I can create `patch-i`), file path(s) and exact file contents, and commit message
- Open an issue titled `patch-i`
  - Needed: repository (owner/name). I can use `patch-i` as title and draft the body for you. Tell me labels/assignees if any.
- Create a pull request from `patch-i`
  - Needed: repository (owner/name), source branch (`patch-i`) and target branch (default: `main`), PR title/body, reviewers/labels
- Something else — describe what you want

If you want me to act on a repository, please provide the repository in owner/name format (for example: `octocat/hello-world`). If you prefer defaults, say so (I’ll use `main` as the base branch and assign issues to your account `boomboomtxzzit-coder` by default).

Which action should I take and what are the repo/details?
